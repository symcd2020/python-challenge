Module 3 Challenege

This assignment was completed with the assistance of ChatGPT and past solved class activities. When using ChatGPT, if it helped me to figure out where I was stuck/struggling I then asked it why it used "xyz" so I could get a better understanding. That really helped me learn the why/what behind the code.
