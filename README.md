Module 3 Challenege

This assignment was completed with the assistance of ChatGPT and past solved class activities. When using ChatGPT, if it helped me to figure out where I was stuck/struggling I then asked it why it used "xyz" so I could get a better understanding. That really helped me learn the why/what behind the code.

To assist with pushing my completed challenege files to my GitHub repository, I referenced the class PowerPoint slide with the git commands. Additionally I googled to learn if I needed to add anything after the git add/commit/push. That was really cool to see my folders and files be pushed to my remote repository! I can't wait to do that more! :)
